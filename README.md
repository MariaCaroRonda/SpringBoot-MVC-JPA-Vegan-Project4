# SpringBoot-MVC-JPA-Vegan-Project4

Vegan Recipes Website Project.
The result of this project has been the development and implementation of a full-stack website. This type of website includes the implementation of three separate development domains or stacks, which are the front-end, back-end and the database, including a proper working connection between the three of them.

I have developed and coded the front-end and back-end of the website using the IntelliJ IDEA development tool.

For the implementation of the back-end I have used the Spring Boot framework and the Java programming language (version 11). 

I have implementated the front-end with Bootstrap (version 4.1) and with Spring Boot Thymeleaf (version 2.7). Bootstrap includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks that allows to build the front-end layout blocks, style them, and add some functionality to the website.
Initially, the HTML files only contained static content. To add dynamic content to the HTML pages and to display the database content to the end-user, I integrated the Thymeleaf engine into the HTML pages. The dynamic content of the website are the Recipes and the (mock) Users data stored in MySQL database.
